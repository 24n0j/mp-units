# Terms and Definitions

The **mp-units** project consistently uses the official metrology vocabulary defined by
the ISO and BIPM. Please familiarize yourself with those terms to better understand
the documentation and improve domain-related communication and discussions.

You can find essential project-related definitions in [our documentation's "Glossary" chapter](../../appendix/glossary).
Even more, terms are provided in the official vocabulary of the [ISO](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:std:iso-iec:guide:99:ed-1:v2:en)
and [BIPM](https://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en).
