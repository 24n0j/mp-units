# mp-units 2.3.0 released!

**A new product version can be obtained from
[GitHub](https://github.com/mpusz/mp-units/releases/tag/v2.3.0) and
[Conan](https://conan.io/center/recipes/mp-units?version=2.3.0).**

This release fine-tunes many key features of the library. This post describes those and a few
other smaller interesting improvements, while a much longer list of the most significant changes
introduced by the new version can be found in our [Release Notes](../../release_notes.md#2.3.0).

## Quantity reference specifiers

The features described in this chapter directly solve an issue raised on
[std-proposals reflector](https://lists.isocpp.org/std-proposals/2024/06/10118.php). As it was
reported, the code below may look correct, but it provides an invalid result:

```cpp
quantity Volume = 1.0 * m3;
quantity Temperature = 28.0 * deg_C;
quantity n_ = 0.04401 * kg / mol;
quantity R_boltzman = 8.314 * N * m / (K * mol);
quantity mass = 40.0 * kg;
quantity Pressure = R_boltzman * Temperature.in(K) * mass / n_ / Volume;
std::cout << Pressure << "\n";
```

The problem is related to the accidental usage of a `quantity` rather than `quantity_point` for
`Temperature`. This means that after conversion to kelvins, we will get `28 K` instead of
the expected `301.15 K`, which will corrupt all further calculations.

A correct code should use a `quantity_point`:

```cpp
quantity_point Temperature(28.0 * deg_C);
```

This might be an obvious thing for domain experts, but new users of the library may not be aware
of the affine space abstractions and how they influence temperature handling.

After a lengthy discussion on handling such scenarios, we decided to aid the `quantity` and
`quantity_point` construction with `absolute<Reference>` and `delta<Reference>` quantity reference
specifiers. This applies to:

- the multiply syntax,
- 2-parameter `quantity` constructor.

Here are the main points of this new design:

1. All references/units that do not specify point origin (are not offset units) in their definition
 are considered `delta` by default. This means that `42 * m` creates a `quantity` and is
 the same as calling `42 * delta<m>`.
2. Multiply syntax is extended to allow `quantity_point` creation with the `42 * absolute<m>`
 syntax. This will provide an implicit zeroth point origin.
3. For units that specify a point origin (`si::kelvin`, `si::degree_Celsius`, and
   `usc::degree_Fahrenheit`), the user always needs to specify a modifier. This means that:
    - `4 * deg_C` does not compile,
    - `4 * delta<deg_C>` creates a `quantity`.
    - `4 * absolute<deg_C>` creates a `quantity_point`.
4. The 2-parameter `quantity` constructor requires the same:

```cpp
quantity q1(4, m); // OK
quantity q2(4, delta<m>); // OK
quantity q3(4, absolute<m>); // Compile-time error
quantity q4(4, deg_C); // Compile-time error
quantity q5(4, delta<deg_C>); // OK
quantity q6(4, absolute<deg_C>); // Compile-time error
```

The `delta` and `absolute` modifiers are stripped upon construction, so the resulting `quantity`
and `quantity_point` types use the underlying unit in its type.

With such changes, the offending code will not compile, forcing the user to think more about what
is written. To enable the compilation, the user has to type one of the following:

- `quantity_point Temperature(28.0 * delta<deg_C>);`
- `quantity_point Temperature = 28.0 * absolute<deg_C>;`

If the user still insists on using `quantity` instead of a `quantity_point`, the code will
have to be written in the following way to compile successfully:

```cpp
quantity Temperature = 28.0 * delta<deg_C>;
```

This will yield an invalid result, but now, hopefully, it is clearly readable in the code what is
wrong here.
