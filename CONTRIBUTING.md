# Contributing to `mp-units`

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

## Gitpod

The easiest way to start coding is to jump straight into [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io). You can either click the button
below or prefix any `mp-units` URL (main branch, other branches, issues, PRs, ...) in your web browser with `gitpod.io/#`
(i.e. https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/mpusz/units).

## Download, Build, Install

Alternatively, please refer to our official docs for [download, build, and install instructions](https://mpusz.github.io/units/usage.html)
if you want to setup a development environment on your local machine.

## Where to start?

If you are looking for a good issue to start with, please check the following:

- [good first issue](https://github.com/mpusz/units/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues that should be pretty simple to implement.
- [help wanted](https://github.com/mpusz/units/labels/help%20wanted) - issues that typically are a bit more involved than beginner issues.
- [high priority](https://github.com/mpusz/units/labels/high%20priority) - things to fix ASAP but often of higher complexity.

## Naming Conventions

Here are the main rules for naming things in this repo:

- types, functions, variables naming in a `standard_case`
- template parameters in a `PascalCase`
- C++20 concepts names for now in a `PascalCase` but we plan to change it (see https://github.com/mpusz/units/issues/93 for more details)

## Code Formatting

Please use `clang-format-15` for code formatting with the `.clang-format` file provided in the repo.

If you are unable to install or use `clang-format-15`, here are the main rules to follow:

- LF line endings
- 2 spaces for indentation
  - `requires` clause indented with 2 spaces as well
- no indentation for namespaces
- function opening brace in the new line
  - all other opening braces attached to the current context at the end of the same line

## Backward Compatibility

Before submission, please remember to check if the code compiles fine on the supported compilers.
The CI will check it anyway but it is good to check at least some of the configurations before pushing changes.
Especially older compilers can be tricky as those do not support all the C++20 features well enough. The official
list of supported compilers can be always found on our [Usage page](https://mpusz.github.io/units/usage.html).
